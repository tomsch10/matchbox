","Base for all types and resources","A concept descriptor represents any kind of concept usually by giving a code defined in a code system. A concept descriptor can contain the original text or phrase that served as the basis of the coding and one or more translations into different coding systems. A concept descriptor can also contain qualifiers to describe, e.g., the concept of a ""left foot"" as a postcoordinated term built from the primary code ""FOOT"" and the qualifier ""LEFT"". In exceptional cases, the concept descriptor need not contain a code but only the original text describing that concept.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Base",0,*,"","","n/a"
