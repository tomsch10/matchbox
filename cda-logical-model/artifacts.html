<p>A derivative of the RIM Act class, to be used when the other more specific classes aren’t appropriate.</p>

<p>Act.negationInd, when set to “true”, is a positive assertion that the Act as a whole is negated. Some properties such as Act.id, Act.moodCode, and the participations are not affected. These properties always have the same meaning: i.e., the author remains the author of the negative Act. An act statement with negationInd is still a statement about the specific fact described by the Act. For instance, a negated “finding of wheezing on July 1” means that the author positively denies that there was wheezing on July 1, and that he takes the same responsibility for such statement and the same requirement to have evidence for such statement than if he had not used negation.</p>

<p>Represents a participant who has attested to the accuracy of the document, but who does not have privileges to legally authenticate the document.

While electronic signatures are not captured in a CDA document, both authentication and legal authentication require that a document has been signed manually or electronically by the responsible individual. An authenticator has a required authenticator.time indicating the time of authentication, and a required authenticator.signatureCode, indicating that a signature has been obtained and is on file.</p>

<p>Represents a participant who has legally authenticated the document. The CDA is a standard that specifies the structure of exchanged clinical documents.

A CDA document can reflect the unauthenticated, authenticated, or legally authenticated state. The unauthenticated state exists when no authentication information has been recorded (i.e., it is the absence of being either authenticated or legally authenticated). While electronic signatures are not captured in a CDA document, both authentication and legal authentication require that a document has been signed manually or electronically by the responsible individual. A legalAuthenticator has a required legalAuthenticator.time indicating the time of authentication, and a required legalAuthenticator.signatureCode, indicating that a signature has been obtained and is on file.</p>

<p>Observation.negationInd, when set to “true”, is a positive assertion that the Observation as a whole is negated. Some properties such as Observation.id, Observation.moodCode, and the participations are not negated. These properties always have the same meaning: i.e., the author remains the author of the negative Observation. An observation statement with negationInd is still a statement about the specific fact described by the Observation. For instance, a negated “finding of wheezing on July 1” means that the author positively denies that there was wheezing on July 1, and that he takes the same responsibility for such statement and the same requirement to have evidence for such statement than if he had not used negation.</p>

<p>An XML attribute “ID” of type XML ID, is added to ObservationMedia within the CDA Schema. This attribute serves as the target of a renderMultiMedia reference (see renderMultiMedia). All values of attributes of type XML ID must be unique within the document (per the W3C XML specification).</p>

<p>The distinction between ObservationMedia and ExternalObservation is that ObservationMedia entries are part of the attested content of the document whereas ExternalObservations are not. For instance, when a clinician draws a picture as part of a progress note, that picture is represented as a CDA ObservationMedia. If that clinician is also describing a finding seen on a chest-x-ray, the referenced chest-x-ray is represented as a CDA ExternalObservation.</p>

<p>The reference class contains the attribute reference.seperatableInd, which indicates whether or not the source is intended to be interpreted independently of the target. The indicator cannot prevent an individual or application from separating the source and target, but indicates the author’s desire and willingness to attest to the content of the source if separated from the target. Typically, where seperatableInd is “false”, the exchanged package should include the target of the reference so that the recipient can render it.</p>

Some properties such as SubstanceAdministration.id, SubstanceAdministration.moodCode, and the participations are not affected. These properties always have the same meaning: i.e., the author remains the author of the negative SubstanceAdministration. A substance administration statement with negationInd is still a statement about the specific fact described by the SubstanceAdministration. For instance, a negated “aspirin administration” means that the author positively denies that aspirin is being administered, and that he takes the same responsibility for such statement and the same requirement to have evidence for such statement than if he had not used negation.</p>

<p>SubstanceAdministration.priorityCode categorizes the priority of a substance administration. SubstanceAdministration.doseQuantity indicates how much medication is given per dose. SubstanceAdministration.rateQuantity can be used to indicate the rate at which the dose is to be administered (e.g., the flow rate for intravenous infusions). SubstanceAdministration.maxDoseQuantity is used to capture the maximum dose of the medication that can be given over a stated time interval (e.g., maximum daily dose of morphine, maximum lifetime dose of doxorubicin). SubstanceAdministration.effectiveTime is used to describe the timing of administration. It is modeled using the GTS data type to accommodate various dosing scenarios.</p>

<p>The capture of medication-related information also involves the interrelationship of SubstanceAdministration with several other classes. The consumable participation is used to bring in the LabeledDrug or Material entity that describes the administered substance. The LabeledDrug class, which is an Entity class playing the Role of Manufactured Product, identifies the drug that is consumed in the substance administration. The medication is identified by means of the LabeledDrug.code or the LabeledDrug.name. The Material entity is used to identify non-drug administered substances such as vaccines and blood products.</p>

<p>The Supply class represents dispensing, whereas the SubstanceAdministration class represents administration. Prescriptions are complex activities that involve both an administration request to the patient (e.g. take digoxin 0.125mg by mouth once per day) and a supply request to the pharmacy (e.g. dispense 30 tablets, with 5 refills). This should be represented in CDA by a SubstanceAdministration entry that has a component Supply entry. The nested Supply entry can have Supply.independentInd set to “false” to signal that the Supply cannot stand alone, without it’s containing SubstanceAdministration. The following example illustrates a prescription representation in CDA.</p>
