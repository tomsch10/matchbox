This identifier can be used to trace the participation of an entity in a given role, but cannot necessarily be used to determine that two entities are the same. While more role identities could be provided whose intended use is to unify the entities, this is better modeled through the use of an entity identifier. Therefore, to facilitate this capability, this guide defines an extension to CDA Release 2.0 that allows the person or organization playing the role to be uniquely identified, by the inclusion of an identifier on the entity.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"SubjectPerson.sdtcId",0,*,"",""
