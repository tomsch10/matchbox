A reason link is weaker than a trigger, it only suggests that some service may be or might have been a reason for some action, but not that this reason requires/required the action to be taken. Also, as opposed to the trigger, there is no strong timely relation between the reason and the action. As well as providing various types of information about the rationale for a service, the RSON act relationship is routinely used between a SBADM act and an OBS act to describe the indication for use of a medication. Child concepts may be used to describe types of indication.<br/><br/>*Discussion:* In prior releases, the code "SUGG" (suggests) was expressed as "an inversion of the reason link." That code has been retired in favor of the inversion indicator that is an attribute of ActRelationship.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/5.3.0/CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-MITGT">MITGT</a></td><td style="color: #cccccc">mitigates</td><td>The source act removes or lessens the occurrence or effect of the target act.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/5.3.0/CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-CIND">CIND</a></td><td style="color: #cccccc">has contra-indication</td><td>A contraindication is just a negation of a reason, i.e. it gives a condition under which the action is not to be done. Both, source and target can be any kind of service; target service is in criterion mood. How the strength of a contraindication is expressed (e.g., relative, absolute) is left as an open issue. The priorityNumber attribute could be used.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/5.3.0/CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-PRCN">PRCN</a></td><td style="color: #cccccc">has pre-condition</td><td>A requirement to be true before a service is performed. The target can be any service in criterion mood.

The target is in typically in criterion mood. When reported after the fact (i.e. the criterion has been met) it may be in Event mood. A delay between the trigger and the triggered action can be specified.<br/><br/>*Discussion:* This includes the concept of a required act for a service or financial instrument such as an insurance plan or policy. In such cases, the trigger is the occurrence of a specific condition such as coverage limits being exceeded.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/5.3.0/CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-COMP">COMP</a></td><td style="color: #cccccc">has component</td><td>The target act is a component of the source act, with no semantics regarding composition or aggregation implied.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/5.3.0/CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-ARR">ARR</a></td><td style="color: #cccccc">arrival</td><td>The relationship that links to a Transportation Act (target) from another Act (source) indicating that the subject of the source Act entered into the source Act by means of the target Transportation act.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/5.3.0/CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-CTRLV">CTRLV</a></td><td style="color: #cccccc">has control variable</td><td>A relationship from an Act to a Control Variable.

Target must be an observation as a goal, risk or any criterion. For complex outcomes a conjunction attribute (AND, OR, XOR) can be used. An outcome link is often inverted to describe an outcome assessment.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/5.3.0/CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-GOAL">GOAL</a></td><td style="color: #cccccc">has goal</td><td>A goal that one defines given a patient's health condition.

A clinical act may have a charge associated with the execution or delivery of the service.<br/><br/>The financial transaction will define the charge (bill) for delivery or performance of the service.<br/><br/>Charges and costs are distinct terms. A charge defines what is charged or billed to another organization or entity within an organization. The cost defines what it costs an organization to perform or deliver a service or product.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/5.3.0/CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-COST">COST</a></td><td style="color: #cccccc">has cost</td><td>A relationship that provides an ability to associate a financial transaction (target) as a cost to a clinical act (source). A clinical act may have an inherit cost associated with the execution or delivery of the service.<br/><br/>The financial transaction will define the cost of delivery or performance of the service.<br/><br/>Charges and costs are distinct terms. A charge defines what is charged or billed to another organization or entity within an organization. The cost defines what it costs an organization to perform or deliver a service or product.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/5.3.0/CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-CREDIT">CREDIT</a></td><td style="color: #cccccc">has credit</td><td>A credit relationship ties a financial transaction (target) to an account (source). A credit, once applied (posted), may have either a positive or negative effect on the account balance, depending on the type of account. An asset account credit will decrease the account balance. A non-asset account credit will decrease the account balance.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/5.3.0/CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-DEBIT">DEBIT</a></td><td style="color: #cccccc">has debit</td><td>A debit relationship ties a financial transaction (target) to an account (source). A debit, once applied (posted), may have either a positive or negative effect on the account balance, depending on the type of account. An asset account debit will increase the account balance. A non-asset account debit will decrease the account balance.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/5.3.0/CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-SAS">SAS</a></td><td style="color: #cccccc">starts after start of</td><td>The source Act starts after the start of the target Act (i.e. if we say "ActOne SAS ActTwo", it means that ActOne starts after the start of ActTwo, therefore ActOne is the source and ActTwo is the target).<br/><br/>*UsageNote:* Inverse code is **SBS**</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/5.3.0/CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-SPRT">SPRT</a></td><td style="color: #cccccc">has support</td><td>Used to indicate that an existing service is suggesting evidence for a new observation. The assumption of support is attributed to the same actor who asserts the observation. Source must be an observation, target may be any service (e.g., to indicate a status post).</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/5.3.0/CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-SPRTBND">SPRTBND</a></td><td style="color: #cccccc">has bounded support</td><td>A specialization of "has support" (SPRT), used to relate a secondary observation to a Region of Interest on a multidimensional observation, if the ROI specifies the true boundaries of the secondary observation as opposed to only marking the approximate area. For example, if the start and end of an ST elevation episode is visible in an EKG, this relation would indicate the ROI bounds the "ST elevation" observation -- the ROI defines the true beginning and ending of the episode. Conversely, if a ROI simply contains ST elevation, but it does not define the bounds (start and end) of the episode, the more general "has support" relation is used. Likewise, if a ROI on an image defines the true bounds of a "1st degree burn", the relation "has bounded support" is used; but if the ROI only points to the approximate area of the burn, the general "has support" relation is used.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/5.3.0/CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-PERT">PERT</a></td><td style="color: #cccccc">has pertinent information</td><td>This is a very unspecific relationship from one item of clinical information to another. It does not judge about the role the pertinent information plays.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/5.3.0/CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-AUTH">AUTH</a></td><td style="color: #cccccc">authorized by</td><td>A relationship in which the target act authorizes or certifies the source act.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/5.3.0/CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-CAUS">CAUS</a></td><td style="color: #cccccc">is etiology for</td><td>**Description:** An assertion that an act was the cause of another act.This is stronger and more specific than the support link. The source (cause) is typically an observation, but may be any act, while the target may be any act.<br/><br/>**Examples:**<br/><br/> *  a growth of Staphylococcus aureus may be considered the cause of an abscess<br/> *  contamination of the infusion bag was deemed to be the cause of the infection that the patient experienced<br/> *  lack of staff on the shift was deemed to be a supporting factor (proximal factor) causing the patient safety incident where the patient fell out of bed because the bed-sides had not been put up which caused the night patient to fall out of bed</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/5.3.0/CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-COVBY">COVBY</a></td><td style="color: #cccccc">covered by</td><td>A relationship in which the source act is covered by or is under the authority of a target act. A financial instrument such as an Invoice Element is covered by one or more specific instances of an Insurance Policy.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/5.3.0/CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-DRIV">DRIV</a></td><td style="color: #cccccc">is derived from</td><td>Associates a derived Act with its input parameters. E.G., an anion-gap observation can be associated as being derived from given sodium-, (potassium-,), chloride-, and bicarbonate-observations. The narrative content (Act.text) of a source act is wholly machine-derived from the collection of target acts.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/5.3.0/CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-EXPL">EXPL</a></td><td style="color: #cccccc">has explanation</td><td>This is the inversion of support. Used to indicate that a given observation is explained by another observation or condition.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/5.3.0/CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-ITEMSLOC">ITEMSLOC</a></td><td style="color: #cccccc">items located</td><td>Items located</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/5.3.0/CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-LIMIT">LIMIT</a></td><td style="color: #cccccc">limited by</td><td>A relationship that limits or restricts the source act by the elements of the target act. For example, an authorization may be limited by a financial amount (up to $500). Target Act must be in EVN.CRIT mood.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/5.3.0/CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-MFST">MFST</a></td><td style="color: #cccccc">is manifestation of</td><td>An assertion that a new observation may be the manifestation of another existing observation or action. This assumption is attributed to the same actor who asserts the manifestation. This is stronger and more specific than an inverted support link. For example, an agitated appearance can be asserted to be the manifestation (effect) of a known hyperthyroxia. This expresses that one might not have realized a symptom if it would not be a common manifestation of a known condition. The target (cause) may be any service, while the source (manifestation) must be an observation.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/5.3.0/CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-NAME">NAME</a></td><td style="color: #cccccc">assigns name</td><td>Used to assign a "name" to a condition thread. Source is a condition node, target can be any service.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/5.3.0/CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-PREV">PREV</a></td><td style="color: #cccccc">has previous instance</td><td>A relationship in which the target act is a predecessor instance to the source act. Generally each of these instances is similar, but no identical. In healthcare coverage it is used to link a claim item to a previous claim item that might have claimed for the same set of services.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/5.3.0/CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-REFR">REFR</a></td><td style="color: #cccccc">refers to</td><td>A relationship in which the target act is referred to by the source act. This permits a simple reference relationship that distinguishes between the referent and the referee.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/5.3.0/CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-REFV">REFV</a></td><td style="color: #cccccc">has reference values</td><td>Reference ranges are essentially descriptors of a class of result values assumed to be "normal", "abnormal", or "critical." Those can vary by sex, age, or any other criterion. Source and target are observations, the target is in criterion mood. This link type can act as a trigger in case of alarms being triggered by critical results.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/5.3.0/CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-SUBJ">SUBJ</a></td><td style="color: #cccccc">has subject</td><td>Relates an Act to its subject Act that the first Act is primarily concerned with.<br/><br/>Examples<br/><br/>1.
